Installation: 
Need to have ocaml already installed on your computer. Put all of the files in the same folder.
Execution: 
Navigate to the folder containing all the files, open the terminal and type “make output”.
Then execute:
./output INPUT_FILE  OUTPUT_FILE  SCALE 
   INPUT_FILE: direction to input file, from the current folder
   OUTPUT_FILE: name of output file, without extension. It will
   be saved in testsoutputs/OUTPUT_FILE.svg
   SCALE: optional argument to choose the scale to see the image.
   Default is 50 (50 times bigger than original bitmap)

The output files are contained in the folder called “testoutputs.
Open an internet browser and type in file:///HOME_DIRECTORY/PATH_TO_TESTOUTPUTS/OUTPUT_FILE, 
where HOME_DIRECTORY is the address of your home directory, and PATH_TO_TESTOUTPUTS is the path
to the “testoutputs” from your homedirectory, and OUTPUT_FILE is the file name you specified
when you executed ./output..., with the extension “svg”. For example, if you specified “smiley”
as the name of your output, then “smiley.svg” would be your output file. The output file will
contain four images. The top-middle image will be the original bitmap image. The top-left image
will be the bitmap with the grid outline on top. The bottom-left image will be the directed
graph representation of the bitmap produced from step 1. The bottom-right image will be the
images represented as vectorized polygons. The top-rightmost image will be the final output
with some polygons represented by Bezier curves.
